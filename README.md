# Tryhackme challenges

This repository holds my (fast) writeups and notes from the solved challenges from the tryhackme website.

Every directory is a challenge, which includes a `readme.md` where the writeup is located, a `nmap.txt` which has the nmap port scan, and other files used to solve the challenges
